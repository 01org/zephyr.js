By default it will built for arduino 101, to overwrite it, edit the Makefile
or set BOARD=board_name when building.

To Build:

$ make

To build and flash to the arduino 101:

$ source ../../zjs-env.sh
$ ./build.sh 

If you run into any issues building soletta, make you sure have clean copy of soletta source checked out, you can do so by going to the soletta project directory and type

git clean -xdf
