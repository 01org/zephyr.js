jerryscript_test
================
We've foolishly everything but the kitchen sink here, but what this directory
*should* be is just some code to help run the JerryScript unit tests and
JavaScript tests. Carl and Jimmy will work to clean that up soon.

How to run JerryScript unit tests
---------------------------------
Run this command in the console:
./rununittests.sh

This will build and run each unit tests on QEMU, at the end of each unit tests,
you'll need to press ctrl-x,a to exit QEMU so you can proceed to the next one.

If you want to stop mid-way, you can hit ctrl-x,a to exit QEMU followed by
ctrl-c to return to the console.

WARNING: some of the tests might cause QEMU to crash and you might lose your
console and not see anything you type, you can fix that by typing the word
"reset" to restore console terminal.

How to run JerryScript JS tests
-------------------------------
TBD: Carl
