How to run JerryScript unit tests
---------------------------------
Run this command in the console:

  $ cd unit
  $ ./rununittests.sh

This will build and run each unit tests on QEMU, at the end of each unit tests,
you'll need to press ctrl-x,a to exit QEMU so you can proceed to the next one.

If you want to stop mid-way, you can hit ctrl-x,a to exit QEMU followed by
ctrl-c to return to the console.

WARNING: some of the tests might cause QEMU to crash and you might lose your
console and not see anything you type, you can fix that by typing the word
"reset" to restore console terminal.

How to run JerryScript JS tests

To run the JS tests, enter the following commands:
  $ cd jstests
  $ script test.log
  $ ./runtests.sh 2>test.err

IMPORTANT: After tests ran to completion, just enter the command "exit".  You will see
the run logs in jstests/test.log.

If you need to look at the run outputs generated by "make qemu", they are
located in jstests/test_outdir.
