prepare-commit-msg.samsung - Use correct Signed-off-by for Samsung projects

Details
=======
This file is to help working with Samsung upstream projects. Copy it to your
.git/hooks directory for jerryscript and it will automatically add the right
Signed-off-by string to your commits. If you copy it to iotjs or libtuv
directories you will need to update the SIGNPREFIX variable at the top
appropriately.
